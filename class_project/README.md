# I need a project to learn a new language.

So, to help learn C++ I'm going to do a little modeling.

I'm going to run the N-body problem. That is, I'm going to model the orbits of stuff in our Solar System.

And, if I get really advanced, I might build a little space ship that flies around and has to navigate and build/modify flight trajectories as it goes.

## Broad Goals for the Class Project

* Stellar Dynamics
* The N-Body Problem
* Simple Flight Trajectories
* Use a Kalman Filter to navigate my craft

## Versions of the Class Project

1. This is just the two-body problem in Newtonian physics.
 a. This program is just one main.cpp file, no headers, global constants and simple functions. Some structs and pointers, but no arrays.
 b. I love structs. But the C++ pointer syntax seems complicated; I fancy this was poor design.
