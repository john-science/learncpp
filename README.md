## Environment

I will nto attempt to make this repo fully general. For that please see the original website. This repo will only relate to my particular dev environment:

* Compiler: GNU C++
* Operating System: Linux (Ubuntu 18.04)
* IDE: Code::Blocks

## Setup

With Ubuntu 18.04 I had to do very little setup. To install Code::Blocks I had to do:

    sudo apt install codeblocks
    sudo apt-get install build-essential  # This was already on my machine
