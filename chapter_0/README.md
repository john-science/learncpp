# Chapter Zero - Installation, IDE, and Intro

## Installation

With Ubuntu 18.04 I had to do very little setup. To install Code::Blocks I had to do:

sudo apt install codeblocks
sudo apt-get install build-essential  # This was already on my machine

## IDE Setup

TODO: g++ -o HelloWorld HelloWorld.cpp
