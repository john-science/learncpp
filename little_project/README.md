# I need a little project to learn a new language

So, to help learn C++ I'm going to do a little modeling.

I'm going to run the N-body problem. That is, I'm going to model the orbits of the stuff in our Solar System.

And, if I get really advanced, I might build a little space ship that flies around and has to navigate and build/modify flight trajectories as it goes.

## Broad Goals for the Little Project

* Stellar Dynamics
* The N-Body Problem
* Simple Flight Trajectories
* Use a Kalman Filter to navigate my craft
